# UVic Auto Login
Since UVic does not have a 'stay signed in' option, it can get annoying to sign in everyday. This Chrome Extension automates the UVic login process so the user can stay signed in continuously.

# Installation
### Chrome Web Store
Get the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uvic-auto-login/ikagekpkoidmbhocnobegepkgclpkpel) and install normally.

### Manual/Development

1. Clone this repo.
2. In Chrome, open the Extensions settings. (Wrench button -> Tools -> Extensions. Or type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.)
3. On the Extensions settings page, click the "Developer Mode" checkbox.
4. Click the now-visible "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" button. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo, then the src directory under that.
5. The extension should now be visible in your extensions list.
