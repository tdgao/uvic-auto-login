# UVic Auto Login
Since UVic does not have a 'stay signed in' option, it can get annoying to sign in everyday. This Chrome Extension automates the UVic login process so the user can stay signed in continuously.

# Installation

1. Download and unzip files.
2. In Chrome, open the Extensions settings. (Wrench button -> Tools -> Extensions. Or type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.)
3. On the Extensions settings page, click the "Developer Mode" checkbox.
4. Click the now-visible "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" button. Navigate to the directory of download, then select the uvic-auto-login folder.
5. The extension should now be visible in your extensions list.
